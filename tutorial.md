title: Simple Calculator Tutorial in Rust
---

# Goal

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Calculator that is able to do simple Math.

# Previous Knowledge

We'll assume you dont know how to code or have a slim knowledge of coding.

# What you'll learn

You will learn how to build a simple Calculator in Rust. While doing this Tutorial you will also learn basic concepts because as I said before we are assuming that u have none to very little coding knowledge.

# Tutorial
In order for out calculator to work we need to be able to use User Input and User Output, otherwise our Calculator wouldnt really make sense. In order for us to be able to use User Input and User Output we need to write the following statement at the very beginning:
```rust
use std::io;
```
This code statement basically tells Rust that we are using input and output tools from Rusts standard library. Without this user Input and Output wouldnt be possible.

Now we have to add the main Function so we can define the programs starting point. 
```rust
fn main ()
{
}
```

# Result

# What could go wrong?
